## Challenges

We had a challenge where we weren't allowed to use words. We approached this by creating a puzzle where the villagers on the island speak ONLY emojis, which you will have to finish to gain a reputation. We had struggled with communicating to the user about the abilities. We also struggled with the time crunch. Pushing and pulling with GitHub was a headache, which prevented us from working on specific files.
