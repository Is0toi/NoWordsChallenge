# Village Chaos
You are stranded on an island. In a desperate hope of escaping, you gain a reputation with the villagers. Except you realize that you don't understand the language you speak. It's a language that seems unreal??

## Features
- Emotes for communication with villagers
- Interactivity with apple and can
- Controls: WASD to move or arrows

## Why?
This project was made for the shipwrecked hackathon, for our second challenge and first technical project! We had a little less than 24 hours to complete our game, and our prompt was to create a game or app which required no language. 

## Our Approach
We decided to create a game inspired by our adventure, in which the player is also stranded on an island (inspired by the theme of the hackathon, shipwrecked) and must help the villagers with their tasks. However, the villagers cannot communicate their quests through language, and must instead use symbols through emotes to express their desires. 

## Challenges and Lessons
- combining custom art with assets: important to stay organized and ensure uniform pixel size (if we had more time, we would have worked more on this)
- movement mechanics: one member (Charlotte) had previous experience creating a 2d map-based game, but we struggled with asset size
- time crunch: important to stay organized
- godot file management: very difficult to organize heads and collaboration--also important to stay organized, and that everyone knows what they should be working on and what everyone else should be working on
